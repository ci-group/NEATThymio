Thymio Project Documentation

0. Format

	1.	All points are explained in a sequential matter 
	e.g.	1,2,3

	2.	Abbriviasions used are
		e.g.	-	Which stands for exempli gratiƒÅ and is a fancy word for 'for example'
		cmd	-	Stands for command, this is followed by a terminal command
		pwd	-	Means password
		!!!	-	As I'm sure you don't know this stands for PAY ATTENTION and 
				is usually followed by crucial information or a joke
		PI	-	Short for Raspberry PI

1. Setting Up

	1.	Make sure you have a UNIX environment terminal to execute the commands needed to communicate with the Raspberry Pi
	e.g.	MAC OSX or Linux

	2.	Connect to the wifi 
		Channel:	Thymionet
		Password:	172luckytulip75B

		This will only work if you're in room P345

	3.	Download the appropriate packages to execute and test the robots

	e.g.	Phyton 2.7 (or up)
		You should be prompted by the terminal what you're missing


2. Logging In

	1.	Check the I.P. address on the back of the robot you want to use
	e.g.	192.168.1.72

	2.	Connect to the robot with SSH
	cmd	ssh pi@192.168.1.72

	3.	You will be prompted for a password
	pwd	raspberry

	Bonus	To avoid having to put in your password everytime share your public SSH key with the Pi

		Open New Terminal
	cmd	cd ~/.ssh
	cmd	nano id_rsa.pub
		Copy your key
	e.g.	ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1...

		Open Terminal with SSH connection to a PI

	cmd	cd ~/.ssh
	cmd 	nano autorized_keys
		Paste your key below the other ones, make sure there is an enter at the bottom
	cmd	ctrl-o		(save file)
	cmd	ENTER		
	cmd	ctrl-x		(exit file)


3. Executing Scripts

	External One
	1.	Pick your local booting script
	e.g.	start_one.sh
	2.	Execute the script you want
	e.g.	foraging.py
	cmd	./start_one.sh foraging.py 192.168.1.72 1
	!!!	For a reason only god knows the above command requires 3 input parameters
		so fill in your favorite integer after the IP address, above we used 1

	Local Multiple
	1.	Pick your local booting script
	e.g.	start_all.sh
	2.	Open bot.txt (in /clean_src)
	3.	Type in all IPs of PIs you want to start
	e.g.	192.168.1.52
		192.168.1.72
		192.168.1.62
	4.	Execute the script you want
	e.g.	foraging.py
	cmd	./start_all.sh foraging.py


	Other Ways
	1.	Good luck

4. Synchronize 

	Use rsync to post on the PI
	1.	Pick a robot
	e.g.	192.168.1.52
	2.	Pick a file on your laptop
	e.g.	test.txt
	3.	Get its path
	e.g.	/home/user/test.txt
	4.	Rsync it with the PI	
	cmd	rsync /home/test.txt pi@192.168.1.72:~/

	Use rsync to pull from the PI
	1.	Pick a robot
	e.g.	192.168.1.52
	2.	Pick a file on the robot
	e.g.	test.txt
	3.	Get its path
	e.g.	~/test.txt
	4.	Rsync it from the PI
	cmd	rsync pi@192.186.1.72:~/test.txt /home/user/

	Bonus	Folder instead of single file

	cmd	./* for current folder
	e.g.	rsync ./* pi@192.168.1.52:~/
